\section{System Implementation}

\textbf{Project Selection Module}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allows users to select from predefined domains (e.g., AI, Web Development, CVIP) and difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
    \item Provides a user-friendly interface for domain and difficulty selection.
    \item Implements input validation to ensure proper selection before processing.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Project Recommendation Module}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Filters projects based on selected domain and difficulty level using pandas DataFrame operations.
    \item Implements Social Network Analysis (SNA) using NetworkX to analyze project relationships.
    \item Calculates multiple centrality measures (degree, betweenness, eigenvector) for project recommendations.
    \item Applies technology weighting system to prioritize projects based on their technical complexity.
    \item Displays project recommendations with relevant GitHub and YouTube links.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Graph Visualization Module}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generates interactive graph visualizations using Matplotlib.
    \item Displays project relationships and connections.
    \item Highlights selected projects and their relationships with other projects.
    \item Provides visual representation of the recommendation network.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Screenshots}

The landing page of IdeaHub provides a simple interface where users can select their domain of interest and difficulty level to fetch relevant project recommendations. The figure below shows the selection interface with domain and difficulty options.

When recommendations are found, users are presented with a list of relevant projects along with their descriptions and resource links. The system also provides graph visualizations showing the relationships between projects.

If no recommendations are found for the selected criteria, users are shown an appropriate message indicating that no projects match their selection.
